<!-- The player bar also has play and pause buttons that should show/hide under certain conditions. Determine what you should show and when you should show it. Create a markdown table (like the one presented in this checkpoint) to hold this information and send it to your mentor. -->

<!-- The below class "ion-play" needs to hide when mouse hovers and show ion-pause -->
<a class="play-pause">
 <span class="ion-play"></span>
